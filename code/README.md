# How to get final evaluation among different classifiers

1.cd code/

2.python preprocessing.py

3.cd ../scripts/

4.bash test.sh

There will be more detailed guide on usage.

After running, the graph results with be in "result/graph", some text results will be in "result/text".

# How to get feature exploration

1.run jupytor notebook

2.run 'project_preprocessed_visualised.ipynb' in folder 'data_preprocessing_temp'

# How we contribute to our code

## Preprocessing data on numerical features
S1890666 and S1887468 provide files in folder './data_preprocessing_temp'

## Preprocessing data on categorical features & PCA
S1809576 provides code in 'preprocessing.py'

## Classification method & integration of all code files
S1802373 provides code for classification model and organizes all our code with other necessary part to make our code running better
