# Preprocess numerical features & generate graphs

Run project_preprocessed_visualised.ipynb in jupyter notebook to preprocess numerical features and generate graphs in report.

Files in this folder are the work by S1890666 and S1887468.

# Data Preprocessing

python preprocessing.py

# Further process

cd ../scripts/

bash test.sh

There will be more detailed guide on usage.

After running, the graph results with be in "result/graph", some text results will be in "result/text".
